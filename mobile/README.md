# Nexdo mobile (React Native, Expo)

The React Native replacement for the SwiftUI app in `../ios`. It uses the same Railway API and the same `harbor_session` cookie. The migration plan is in [`../docs/IOS_TO_REACT_NATIVE.md`](../docs/IOS_TO_REACT_NATIVE.md).

**Status:** Phase 1 (setup). Screens are placeholders, except the session check at `app/dev/session-check.tsx`. The app runs in **Expo Go**. Nothing here needs a development build yet.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 and npm
- An iPhone with **Expo Go** from the App Store. Expo Go must support SDK 57, so update it if it asks.
- The phone and the Mac on the same Wi‑Fi, or use `--tunnel` (below)

No Xcode or simulator is needed.

## Install

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

## Run on an iPhone with Expo Go

```bash
cd mobile
npx expo start
```

1. A QR code appears in the terminal.
2. On the iPhone, open the **Camera** app and scan the QR code, then tap the banner to open it in Expo Go.
3. If the phone cannot reach the Mac (a different network, or a client or guest Wi‑Fi), stop the server and run `npx expo start --tunnel`. The first run may ask to install `@expo/ngrok`; accept.

The app opens on the sign-in placeholder, or on Today if a session already exists.

## API address

The API origin comes from `extra.apiUrl` in `app.config.ts`:

- Default: `https://harbour-production-f8a0.up.railway.app`
- Override: set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` before starting Metro. The value must be an `https://` origin with no path.

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://my-staging.up.railway.app npx expo start
```

`app.config.ts` is read when Metro starts, so restart `npx expo start` after changing the variable. The API client refuses non-HTTPS addresses, so a local `http://127.0.0.1:43217` server will not work from the phone.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start` | Start Metro for Expo Go |
| `npm test` | Jest (jest-expo, React Native Testing Library). No network: `fetch` is mocked |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint with `eslint-config-expo` |
| `npx expo export --platform ios` | Bundle check without a device |

## Cookie session test (Phase 1 gate)

This checks that the session cookie from sign-in is stored by iOS, sent with later requests, and **survives a force-quit**. If it does not, the fallback is bearer-token support on the server. That is not built yet.

You need an existing, **email-verified** Nexdo account on the production server.

1. Start Metro (`npx expo start`) and open the app in Expo Go on the iPhone.
2. Open the session check:
   - Signed out: tap **Open session check** on the sign-in placeholder.
   - Or open the URL directly: in the Metro terminal, the `exp://…` address plus `/--/dev/session-check`.
3. Tap **Sign out** first, so the test starts from a clean state. Then tap **Who am I**. Expected: *failed*, `ApiError status=401 code=SIGNED_OUT`.
4. Enter the email and password and tap **Sign in**. Expected: *succeeded*, with `{ id, name, email }`. The log shows `POST /api/auth/login` with status `200`.
5. Tap **Who am I**. Expected: *succeeded*, showing your profile (`user.id`, `user.email`, `user.timeZone`, …). The log shows `GET /api/me` with status `200`. **This proves the cookie is sent.**
6. **Force-quit Expo Go:** swipe up from the bottom edge and pause to open the app switcher, then swipe Expo Go away.
7. Reopen Expo Go and open the project again, from **Recently opened** or by scanning the QR code again. Do not sign in. Expected: the app goes straight to **Today** and shows your name.
8. Open the session check again (**Open session check** on Today) and tap **Who am I**. Expected: *succeeded* with your profile. **This proves the cookie persists.**
9. Tap **Sign out**, then **Who am I**. Expected: *failed*, `401 SIGNED_OUT`. This shows sign-out clears the cookie.

**Pass:** steps 5, 7 and 8 succeed.
**Fail:** step 5 fails (the cookie is not sent), or steps 7 and 8 show signed out (the cookie is not persisted). Record the log panel contents (take a screenshot) for the decision on the bearer-token fallback.

The log panel's "Set-Cookie visible" column is informational only. The cookie is `HttpOnly`, and iOS may or may not show the header to JavaScript. That does not change whether the native cookie store keeps it.

Note: Expo Go keeps cookies in its own app container. A standalone or development build has a separate container, so repeat this test once on the first development build.
